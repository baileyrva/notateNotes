# notateNotes
This repository ("notateNotes") is where I (Joe Bailey) developed a node.js application using JavaScript for the University of Richmond boot camp that I am currently enrolled in. The goal for this homework was to become more familiar with Node.js and databases in general by demonstrating the ability to create a working application that utilized databases and server setup. This application had the most indepth directions to date and required multiple different files working cohesively.


## Installation

The applicaiton is deployed using github pages. New notes can be created seamlessly, and older notes can be deleted by simply clicking the icon next to the undesireable note. 

## User Story
**As a** productive user\
**I want** to create notes/reminders/lists\
**So that** I have quick access to tasks and items 

## Credits

I was the main creator of the main application and repository. For help when facing obstacles I leaned on my friend Blake, and my friend Chris. Blake is a programmer with 7+ years in the business, and Chris is a work friend who is a fantastic problem solver. I also used YouTube to find different videos on JavaScript, generating HTML, and various troubleshooting tips.
